    <h1>Swedish meatballs</h1>

    <img src="swedish-meatballs.webp" alt="Swedish meatballs" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's Swedish meatball recipe. This isn't the kind a lot of
      people are used to in a creamy white sauce. She served them every
      Christmas Eve in a chafing dish as part of the 'Smörgåsbord.' My mom used
      to have a vegetable sour cream and a lingonberry sauce on the table for
      those that might want to dip these in something.

        This is my mom's Swedish meatball recipe. This isn't the kind a lot of
        people are used to in a creamy white sauce. She served them every
        Christmas Eve in a chafing dish as part of the 'Smörgåsbord.' My mom
        used to have a vegetable sour cream and a lingonberry sauce on the table
        for those that might want to dip these in something.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs, water, and half-and-half in a large bowl; let stand
        for about 2 minutes. Stir cooked onion, ground beef, ground pork, salt,
        white pepper, and sugar into bread crumb mixture until thoroughly mixed.
        Shape mixture into about 48 very small meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet; add meatballs. Brown slowly,
        allowing about 25 minutes, until meatballs are fully cooked in the
        middle and no longer pink. Shake pan occasionally to cook evenly.
