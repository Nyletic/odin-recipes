    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A German pancake (a.k.a. a Dutch baby) is similar to a large Yorkshire
      pudding. Unlike other types of pancakes, German pancakes are baked in the
      oven instead of fried on the stove. They also donâ€™t contain leaving
      ingredients, such as baking powder or baking soda.
